# Machine Learning Algorithms Overview

This repository provides implementations and explanations of various machine learning algorithms. Here's a brief overview of the key algorithms covered:

## 1) Linear Regression
Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous outcome variable based on one or more input features. It establishes a linear relationship between the inputs and the target variable, making it valuable for tasks like predicting house prices or sales forecasts.

## 2) K-Nearest Neighbours
K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) is a simple and intuitive classification algorithm that works by finding the 'k' nearest data points in the training set to a given input sample. It classifies the input based on the majority class among its neighbors, making it effective for pattern recognition and anomaly detection tasks.

## 3) Decision Tree
Decision trees are versatile machine learning algorithms used for both classification and regression tasks. They work by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on the most significant feature, forming a tree-like structure. Decision trees are interpretable and can handle both numerical and categorical data.

## 4) Regression Tree
Regression trees are a variation of decision trees used specifically for regression tasks. Instead of predicting classes, regression trees predict a continuous output value for the target variable. They are useful for tasks like predicting house prices or stock market trends where the outcome is a numerical value.

## 5) Logistic Regression
Despite its name, logistic regression is a classification algorithm used for binary and multiclass classification problems. It calculates the probability of a sample belonging to a particular class using the logistic function. Logistic regression is widely used in areas such as spam email detection and customer churn prediction.

## 6) Support Vector Machine
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the hyperplane that best divides the classes in a high-dimensional space. SVM is effective in high-dimensional spaces and is widely used in image recognition and text classification.

## 7) Multiclass Prediction
Multiclass prediction refers to the task of classifying input samples into more than two classes. Algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks can be adapted to handle multiclass classification problems. Techniques like one-vs-all and one-vs-one are commonly used for multiclass prediction.

## 8) K-means Clustering
K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into 'k' distinct, non-overlapping subsets called clusters. It groups similar data points together, making it valuable for customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and image compression.

## 9) Final Project
The final project in this repository encompasses the practical application of these machine learning algorithms. It allows you to implement, experiment, and analyze the algorithms in real-world scenarios, providing valuable insights into their strengths and limitations.
